<div class="resume-header">
  <p>I currently have availibility for ~10 hours a week on interesting moonlighting workâ€”diving into projects where I can use my extensive experience to work on projects that need maintainable, accessible work done on relatively short timelines. I use these projects to fund adventures with my kids.</p>
  <p>If you have current needs, reach out! I'd love to help determine whether my skills will be helpful with your specific needs. I charge hourly but if the project is well scoped I can work with you on set project price. I have built my career by only committing to deadlines or projects I was sure I could accomplish and I have no interest in threatening that record.</p>
