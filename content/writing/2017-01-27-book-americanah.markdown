A brilliant novel that spans decades and cultures and countries to tell a beautiful story. Ifemelu and Obinze, the central characters, are captivating and so human and I could not put this book down. I read it in less than a week; entirely engrossed in their stories and the worlds that Adichie builds around them. This book has been widely praised and I can only add my echo to the pile. If my "to read" list weren't so long I might have started this book over again immediately.
