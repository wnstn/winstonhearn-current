I love books. Not simply the written word, not only prose, but _books_. This site exists mostly so I can keep track of the books I read. Adding a completed book is a delightful ritual, and whenever I can't recall which book I read that thing in, I can scroll through the reading page and find it fairly quickly. I was the 12 year old kid who asked for adult-level non-fictions at Christmas (and got them, and read them). I am now a college dropout who reads multiple academic books a year _for fun, because I enjoy them_. Books! 

One of my focuses this year is embracing joy and pleasure, a result of past years' reading (adrienne maree brown's _Pleasure Activism_ is your key here) and my ongoing healing and growth. For years, the mantra that most resonated within me was Julien Baker's lyrics from _[Appointments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBu21i9aEE)_: "Maybe it's all gonna turn out all right / and I know that it's not / but I have to believe that it is." Those lyrics captured for me the idea that _hope is a discipline_ (to quote the idea I first heard from Mariame Kaba). But sometime last year I noticed that the resonance of these lyrics had faded. No longer was I in a place where I knew that it wouldn't turn out all right and still was choosing to act and believe like it would. Instead, 2022 marked a turning point into a period of life where—to my utter and ongoing surprise—things were going well. My life was stable and full of love, I was no longer struggling to hold on.

And so I needed a new mantra. What emerged, somewhat organically, was an inversion of a Mary Oliver line. Long have I loved her poem Don't Hesitate, and long has the concluding line "Joy is not made to be a crumb" been a helpful reminder for me. I have always lived as if joy _was_ made to be a crumb, a tiny morsel I was allowed to delight in occasionally and only once all other tasks were accomplished and I had nothing better to be doing. I no longer believe this (maybe one day I will write about *that* healing journey lol) and as I expanded my capacity to experience joy, I also found I wanted more than Oliver's negation statement (of what joy is not meant to be). And thus, in a moment of silliness, I typed into a group chat the declaration that "joy is made to be a big crusty loaf." A mantra, newly resonant, delivered to me from my dad joke brain.

Joy comes in many forms, but as mentioned above, books is one of my original joys. I feel an immense excitement when I pick up a book that seems interesting; in my hands I hold the knowledge and work of some other human I may never meet! But I can change the way I think by listening to the things they have written, and exploring the ideas they present. 

However, joy this year needs to be a bit frugal because my partner and I are pursuing a few dreams that reduce my book-buying budget. So I thoughts to myself, what if I survey my bookshelves and build a reading list based on what I have! Maybe I'll find 10 or 12 really exciting books that will help reduce my desire to buy more books! I did this, and uh, I found 32 books (plus there are 3 more on the way lol). Below is my list of books, I'm capturing here as much for reference (again, I use this site more than anyone else), but also so I can check in again next year and see how I did!
