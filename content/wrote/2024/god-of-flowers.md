I've been writing some poetry lately, and while most of I'm writing for me, I felt like sharing this one.

**the god of flowers**

she had watched for eons\
as the surface cooled\
as the water explored the terrain\
as beings emerged from the sea\
as cells explored photosynthesis\
as limbs evolved\
and some even became wings

a tapestry of interdependence\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;and possibility

our god is so patient.\
she had seen other gods\
introduce new threads

their artistry expressed in\
ecological niches\
charismatic megafauna\
fungal experimentation\
symbiotic pairings

still she watched

she would play on the unseen\
colors of the rainbow\
sliding down the infrared\
climbing up the ultraviolet

until some other god\
distantly yelled their version of\
Eureka!

our god is so patient\
is how the flowers tell it

sometimes it takes a lot\
of work that looks unproductive\
to give an idea space to gestate

our god is so good\
at looking completely useless\
superfluous even\
just taking up space

butâ€”\
the flowers whisper this part\
for dramatic emphasis

eventually she noticed how little\
fanfare was paid when\
the earth turned towards\
the sun\
and the snow melted\
and the water ran\
and sure, there was\
the slow emergence of green

but the animals met\
the solar glory with energy\
unmatched by their botanical peers

the bees kept joining her\
on the infrared slide\
to get the energy out

our god is so patient

but that day all her\
unproductivity finally came together

and as the idea bloomed\
she became our god
