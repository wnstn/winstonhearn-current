i used to believe it was required of me\
to look every horror in its face

to inquire of it\
what made the evil at its heart

but after a long time in the company\
of all the ways we have found\
to destroy and harm and terrorize\
all the life around us,\
to kill and maim and betray

i realized there's no need to be\
so confused

whether god is revealed\
within cathedrals\
made of stone and glass\
or datasets and matrix math

men are always inventing god\
so that god can put men in charge\
so that god can decide other people\
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;aren't as important\
so that god can declare the world broken\
so that god can tell the men to fix it\
so that the men can feel free

to believe their desires fix the world

sooner or later\
we will remember\
seeds are not a metaphor—\
not some elaborate lesson\
designed to teach us a way forward

life creates more life\
and if it cannot do that—
