I am a monster. When I travel by plane, which unfortunately because of personal obligations, I have to do monthly, I always take a window seat and leave the shade up the entire time. I'm one of those people. I've seen people complain about this, how it impacts device usage or makes it harder to sleep, but those are not compelling arguments to me. I'm far too interested in looking at the land below, seeing the tops of clouds, paying attention to how visible humans impact on the earth is.

I like to notice the roads, the fields, the power plants, the buildings, the edges of forests and the curves of rivers. How few humans in the history of humanity have been able to get a larger picture of what exactly it is we're doing to the planet? Flying is magic. It's also not feasible for us to continue doing in current forms if we want to create a humane future.

The future is a thing I find myself contemplating a lot these days, between an ongoing personal obsession with climate change and the neverending presidential election. I ask myself questions like what world do I want to live in? What world am I working to build? What worlds am I fighting to avoid?

This post is me thinking out loud, a work in progress, ideas that I am wrestling through but not at all settled with. It's partially an attempt to mark where I am in answering the above questions, and partly an attempt to figure out why I am leaning the way I am in politics these days. I want to hop into a figurative plane, circle above the world of ideas, and try to make sense of what the hell I'm thinking.

A future that I want to live in is one where people have as much agency as possible in choosing what a good life is for them. As I look around the world today and try to understand how that is not true in our current reality, a large thing that jumps out at me is where power is located. The centers of power tend to be very far away from us as individual people. Large, multinational corporations organize vast global supply chains, needing labor from millions of people to keep their profits flowing. The US government is a vast bereaucracy that's tasked with organizing life for hundreds of millions of people. The US is organized such that any given person has multiple layers of government interacting with their life, with local, county, state, and federal systems all affecting things.

In this system, the constraints a person may feel on their agency and choice in life can come from powers that are so distant. I think the goal of giving as much agency to individuals requires us to rethink these systems. I'm not sure we can build a more humane future if



My main thesis is electing a socialist president is putting the cart before the horse. Socialism must be a groundswell movement, which we don't get to by starting with the presidency.

My larger issue is I'm not sure it's possible to make America socialist. I think we are too big, there is no conceivablbe way for 330+million people to collectively govern. We have to imagine smaller politics in order to foster more direct self-government.

To get there, we can imagine many paths, but I would like to choose some threads to build a case for one.

Let's start with capitalism itself, and the market system we have in America today. Numerous historians and thinkers have documented that much of America's wealth, and its extremely unequal distribution are due to chattel slavery and the present-to-today institution of white supremacy. This has led to the term "racial capitalism"; the concept that in America race and capital are inextricable. Thanks to this insight, my politics are that any attempt to move from a capitalist system must include active, intentional reparations of the legacies of race based injustice.

Under this capitalist system, we have built up a whole vocabulary around efficiency and productivity that any socialist system would need to dismantle and replace. This work is already being done in disability studies and crip theory, where theorists are challenging why "productive humans" are the goal, and troubling our assumptions of what we should culturally expect of huans.

I perceive the work of crip theorists as a socialist project because they are expanding our ideas of what a good life is, opening up our models of what a human is and can be to possibilities long prevented by a capitalist system and its demands.

The work feels parallel to indigenous communities who continue to fight to retain their traditions, beliefs, and cultural knowledge. Many indigenous communities present a fundamental rejection of capitalism by their philosophical rejection of extractive and commodifying relationships to each other and the world. The world that we live on is a necessary participant in conversations about the future. When we listen to it, we recognize that the corrections to these ongoing injustices are urgent. We have ignored and blown past boundaries that would have made our future on earth sustainable. We speak these days of the green new deal, an amorphous, to-be-defined project that could be a way America beings to atone for its sins.

Our problems are not just the climate crisis, but also the poisoning of so much of the earth, the way race maps to that poisoning, and the fact that the capitalist system that creates, extends, invests in these problems has not been weakened and in fact remains foundational to all current plans for the future. We are still reliant on the infrastructure of our destruction.

The question is, how do we change that?
