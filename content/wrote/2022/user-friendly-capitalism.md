If you have paid attention to media criticism in the past few years, you may be aware of a common issue that the media has when reporting on police. This issue was humorously and actively explored by McSweeneys in the piece [An Interactive Guide to Passive Grammar](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-ambiguous-grammar) which leads the reader on a journey to turn the active sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." into the "past exonerative tense" sentence: "Speed was involved in a jumping‑related incident with a lazy dog while a fox was brown." 

In this example, a sentence that involves a fox being described while performing an action turns into a sentence that contains a lot of information and no specified actors. The conclusion points to a real news article that uses similar language to describe a cop killing a black man with similar language that avoids describing any cop as an active participant in the murder.

Language that avoids identifying actors and causes is not an accident; it's a decision the author makes. When this choice is made, an author is helping to excuse people from being accountable for their actions, in its worst form this writing avoids identifying any people who might be held accountable. Often that is the goal, intentional or not, to frame stories and perpetuate ideas that certain people aren't responsible for their actions and the systems they inhabit that prevent accountability are thus unnamed and made to feel like simple facts of the universe, much like gravity and the wetness of water. 

I was reminded of this language analysis while reading _User Friendly: How the hidden rules of design are changing the way we live, work, and play_ by Cliff Kuang. The book attempts to tell the story of how designers in the past century have created the world we live in today through the lens of "user-friendliness," the concept that technology should make sense and be easy to use. Kuang describes his book as "one that tries to show how 'user friendly' was invented, how it shapes our everyday rhythms, and where it will go next." The book does root out a bunch of formative history, investigating the post-war creation of industrial design all the way up to self-driving cars and modern smartphone development. But the book fails spectacularly because Kuang is more interested in supporting the established myths inside the design industry rather than following his questions down the paths they point towards.

Towards the end of _User Friendly_, Kuang offers this reflection:

> I've reported and written thousands of stories about digital design, and also designed digital products myself. That entire time I've always assumed that "making things frictionless" was an unalloyed good, right up there with science, efficient markets, and trustworthy courts. But is a user-friendly world actually the best world we can create?

Setting aside his suggest that efficient markets are an unalloyed good, the thing that jumped out at me was the conflation of "making things frictionless" with "user-friendly." This quote, on page 264, would seem to be contradicted by examples earlier in his book about times when designers found that friction was good, that feedback loops are necessary. Even this far into the book, he hasn't clearly laid out his definitions such that he can see the assumptions he's working with, despite his text having proved them quite questionable. A few pages later, he writes a paragraph that captures the heart of my frustration with this book, while talking about the "apotheosis" of personalization:

> Yet in hiding great complexity behind alluringly simple buttons, we also lose the ability to control how things work, to take them apart, and to question the assumptions that guided their creation. Modern user experience is becoming a black box. This is an iron law of user-friendliness: The more seamless an experience is, the more opaque it becomes. When gadgets make decisions for us, they also transform the decisions we might have made into mere opportunities to consume. A world of instantaneous, dead-simple interactions is also a world devoid of higher-order desires and intents that can't readily be parsed in a button. While it may become easier and easier to consume things, it will become harder and harder to express what we truly need. (pp 268-269)

This, to be clear, is a very good critique of user-friendliness and the state of modern consumer design in a world full of networked screens. Read the critique closely though. Where are designers in it? This is a critique of a human-created world that does not implicate any humans for creating it. 

_Design was involved in a world-creating history that a bunch of consumers now live with._

On the very next page, Kuang—who has spent over 250 pages talking to designers who actively created theories and products that have resulted in the world he's describing—again describes a dystopian world that seems to have no active designers in it:

> In purporting to know us better than we know ourselves, user-friendly products trap us in assumptions we can never break. We become rats in a Skinner box with only one lever to push, and so we push and push, because there is nothing else to do.

The book is such a failure because this past-exonerative tense (to use the McSweeney's term) is undermined by the rest of the damn book. Kuang has done an immense amount of research to understand who designed the products he covers. He interviews the designers, the people who know them, and the people who are familiar with the products. He methodically shows how these designers explored the world, theorized about how to better design for it, then attempted to implement their theories. The book is strongest when he explores the gaps between designer intentions and material realities... but those threads are dropped and never expanded on. This is a shame, because those gaps between design intention and real-world impact are the only parts of the book where the systems that designers operate within actually show up. 

Kuang's book, in this regard, fits in well within the field of design books. People who write about design are often designers themselves, and they have an extremely common trait which is well on display in _User Friendly_: everything that is possible for a designer to control is relevant, and everything that is impossible for them to control is either irrelevant or part of the learning process (and thus only relevant for its educational value). What this looks like in writing is that a designer is only reponsible for the scope of the problem as they have defined it, and anything outside of that scope is unimportant.












The thesis of the book seems to be look at all these smart people who have helped build the world that we live in! It's strange how the world sucks, but the designers didn't intend that, so oh well!

Designers have _so much power_ to shape the world, but they are always ignoring the systems they operate within. Capitalism and power! These things exist. they cannot be scoped out of design.

Here is where it's helpful to use a framing definition. I always return to Ursula Franklin's definition of technology because it's so systemic, and User Friendly is far and away focused on designing new technology.

With Franklin's framing, we can think about how "designing a solution" invites new ways of doing things, and designers can be responsible for thinking through the implications of how their designs will impact the world.

Furthermore, we can evaluate designs in a range of ways, we do not need the history of design to be a "just-so" story about how the world came to be, where we try to credit the most influential people. We can learn from the gap between what they thought they were doing and what they actually did, and hold them to account while also building tools to help designers improve.

In this book's framing, people are just gonna keep designing, and we'll keep figuring out if the world is improving or not. We are all subjects to forces that are unnameable and unchangeable, so we just will keep hoping that the next big design solution will actually improve things.
