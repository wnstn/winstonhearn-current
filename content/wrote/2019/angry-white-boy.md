Been thinking recently about anger. Specifically my anger, and how my relationship to it has changed.

For much of my life I've been afraid of anger. I mostly first encountered anger in the context of interpersonal relationships, some person in my life pissing me off for some reason. In those times, I did not inhabit the world in a healthy way; anger heightened my senses and made me feel on edge, looking for ways to verbally retaliate or harm the person to communicate my anger. Anger felt like a diminishing.

In the past decade or so I've taken this long, interesting journey across the American political spectrum. My politics growing up and into my 20's were right-wing. Now I am extremely far-left; let's have public-ownership of utilities and single-payer healthcare, and hell while we're at it, let's cap wealth to $100 million and also the state should do whatever is necessary to seize and shut down fossil-fuel companies. And we sure as hell better dismantle the carceral state, abolishing all prisons.

Like I said, it's been a journey.

When friends hear where I am politically now the obvious question is "what happened?" and I wish I had a neat story. Instead when I was on the other side of politics, I would hear arguments about issues, and look at them closely and figure out if my understanding of how a given issue worked made sense. If it didn't, I'd seek out a different analysis. When you keep doing this, across topics like healthcare and worker's rights and bank regulation and housing rights and any number of the political issues that have cycled through the news in the past 10 years, eventually you start wondering if the system is broken, and you start seeking out ideas for different systems.

With every re-examination, it became clear that my former politics was heavily invested in the status quo (there's a reason Republicans are "conservative"), which meant that there was a lot of political work involved in smoothing over the cognitive dissonance of a system that has been dominated by Republican politics for decades and is fucking over most everyone in the country. Even though Republicans have been the controlling force at state and national levels for a long time, the Republican narrative is that Democrats are on the cusp of destroying everything good about America, signified in all the moral crises that consume all the political oxygen. Gay marriage, abortion rights, whether or not Obama is a muslim (that one was more just racism than moral crisis, sure).

Journalist and writer Mary Heglar has written a few essays now—[such as this on the big lie of Climate Change](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/10/11/17963772/climate-change-global-warming-natural-disasters)—exploring the idea of climate rage. She argues that anger is not only a rational response when you understand the immensity of climate change and the dire consequences we are on course for, but it may be a necessary response. Necessary, because the problem is urgent and anger as an emotion pushes us to action.
