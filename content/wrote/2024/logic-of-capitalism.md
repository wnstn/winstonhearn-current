This week at work I noticed just how goddamn appealing capitalism is, and how sinister it feels. 

I'm working on an exciting product, building something I believe is genuinely useful for a specific set of people. I am also, you know, employed at a business, one that is venture-backed and thus operating under a specific set of requirements. We need to not only be profitable, but profitable in certain ways and on a specific quarter-over-quarter pace. If we do this, there are very clear rewards; I get a salary sure, but I also have some equity in the company that only becomes worth real money under specific circumstances. What this means is that work—for me and my coworkers—is a very specific problem to solve, with a fairly clear reward if we succeed. 

At a very abstract level, I am participating in the core game of life: ensuring my future existence by solving existential problems to find the resources I need to survive. Or, it feels like I'm participating in a universal game, but this game feels very poisoned if I don't think of it quite so abstractly. This is what caught my attention last week.

Here is how we could describe it. My employer is competing in an "ecosystem" of products, and we are trying to prove ourselves to be the best, to be the "fittest" that survives and succeeds. If we do that, we will claim the spoils of victory, which in capitalism means money. This is the classic "survival of the fittest" narrative, core to our understanding of how evolutionary development works, and thus how the world has come to be.



And yet, we believe "survival of the fittest" to be a truism.
