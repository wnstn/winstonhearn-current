In 2019 I read 73 books; the most I've read in a single year possibly in my entire life. A friend recently asked how I read so fast, and the honest answer is I don't read fast, I just dedicated more time to reading this year than anything else. I stopped watching TV and movies, I found they didn't interest me. If I wasn't with my kids or hanging with friends, I probably had my nose in a book. And thus the year end total. I do not expect to match it in 2020; too many big changes coming.

This post is an attempt to summarize my year in reading and point you to some of the notable things I read. I'm not really sure I could name "favorites" of the year, I am extremely choosy about books I read and while I loved and would more strongly recommend specific books (thus this post) I didn't finish reading any book that I hated. Thus my [reading list](/read) itself is a pretty good recommendations list.

In the past few years I've been able to winnow my unending curiosity about the world into some general non-fiction topics: critical analysis of tech, climate change, Black history/race theory, and disability theory. These topics are separated below, but there's still an "other" category because I am bad at focusing. Below non-fiction you'll find fiction; just over half (38 of 73) books I read this year were fiction.

Also, I try not to closely track my stats aside from keeping track of how many books I've read, but by my count only 11 of the 73 books I read were written by white dudes. More importantly, 42 of the 73 were written by people of color or trans writers. I hope I can continue to de-center whiteness in my reading.

### Critical Analysis of Tech

One of my projects in the past few years has been to find every book I can that critically examines the tech industry, and make my way through them. My queue remains long, but I'm learning a lot as I work through it. This year I think the book that stood out to me the most was Marie Hick's _Programmed Inequality_, which examines the way that the British computer industry institutionalized sexism and inequality through centrally organized job descriptions, pay grades, and most importantly, intentional misrepresentations of the complexity of the work women were doing in the decades after WWII.

The book is a fantastic history of the ways that the institutions (or, the men with power inside the institutions) conspired to push women out of the possibilities the new industry offered. The book also includes first-hand accounts from women involved in the industry to help us understand what their lives and jobs were like. Hick's book is not uplifting; it's a story of systemic injustice and harm, but reading it, I recognized how relevant it is to our current era.

Other books that I enjoyed this year on this topic:

* Ursula Franklin's _The Real World of Technology_, which I was rereading for the 4th time.
* Meredith Broussard's _Artificial Intelligence_, an excellent overview of the flaws inherent in Machine Learning and AI.
* Sarah Robert's _Behind the Screen_, a necessary exploration of the content moderation industry.
* Frank Pasquale's _The Black Box Society_, a book whose first 2/3's are incredibly necessary, examining how tech and finance are rapidly adopting algorithmic tools that are extremely hard to understand or regulate, but whose final third still leaned a bit too techno-utopian for me.
* Andrew Guthrie Ferguson's _The Rise of Big Data Policing_, which I found had excellent legal analysis against big data policing but still presumed there were technological solutions to be found to address the problems (a presumption I reject).

This coming year I have a large queue of more books on this topic and can't wait to see what else I learn.
