A few years ago I wanted to learn more about web accessibility, and the rabbit hole I fell down led me to encounter the discipline of Disability Theory, and the wide world of knowledge-making that disabled people are working within as they find community and figure out how to talk about the broad-range of human capacity and abilities. There are so many books, articles, blogs, tweets and IG posts that are building this knowledge, so this list is not comprehensive, it's just the books I recommend the most.

{{<rec title="Building Access">}}

This is one of the first books I read inside the field of Disability Theory and it continues to be one I cite regular. Hamraie examines the history of Universal Design to understand its crip origins and how it has been watered down and co-opted by the field of design. The book is critical for anyone in the design industry to read.

{{<rec title="Disability History of United States" layout="flipped">}}

This book, part of the Revisioning History series, re-examines the chapters of US History from the perspective how we (mis)treated disabled people. A history that is mostly horrifying but incredibly important to understand; disabled people continue to struggle to have their concerns taken seriously. Many people consider the passage of the ADA as a moment when problems were solved; this book points to how that legislation was a mere start to begin addressing a long history of injustice.

{{<rec title="Disability Visibility" >}}

A fantastic collection of first-person essays about disability. Disability intersects across all sorts of injustices; racism, sexism, ageism and more, and this collection explores the many contributor's experiences in the ways they desire to tell them. A great read for challenging your assumptions about disability and learning to better see ableism in its myriad forms.
