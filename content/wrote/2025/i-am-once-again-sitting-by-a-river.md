we have flooded\
that which is quite used to floods\
only, we saw that which

as wasted potential\
as inefficient\
as uncivilized

so we tried to control\
that which had needed no control\
so we dumped whatever we no longer wanted\
into that which—without needing control—\
had always managed itself\
so we made inhospitable to so many beings\
that which had always had space for more

i am sitting on the banks of\
that which we civilized through\
dams         dredges     dumping\
that which we demand serve our purposes\
before and above any others

it does not feel unwild\
it does not feel civilized

it seems to understand\
that which believes itself to be in control\
has not yet been flooded\
with the lessons of time
